# Meta-Ad-Performance
**Project Overview** 

This is a Meta Ad Performance Dashboard that tracks the effectiveness of ad campaigns 
across key KPIs such as impressions, clicks, engagements, conversions, and budget. It 
provides a complete funnel view—from awareness to engagement to purchases—along with 
demographic, geographic, and time-based insights.

**Data Collection**

The dataset was downloaded from a publicly available source.

This dataset represents Meta Ads Performance Data, covering campaigns, ads, user 
demographics, and ad interaction events. It is modelled after how Facebook/Instagram 
(Meta) ad platforms capture data. 

The purpose of this dataset is to analyse advertising performance, optimize targeting, and 
measure ROI (Return on Investment) through KPIs.

**🎯 Dashboard Insights & Recommendations** 

1. Strong awareness & engagement, but low purchase efficiency → optimize landing 
pages, retargeting, and offers.

2. Target audience = young females, 18–30, in India & Brazil → refine campaigns 
accordingly.

3. Best formats = Video and Stories → increase spend here.
   
4. Best times = afternoons & evenings → schedule ads accordingly.
   
5. Geography → volume from India/Brazil, value from Germany/UK → segment 
strategies.

If I were leading this project, I’d focus on conversion optimization and retargeting 
strategies to capture the users who engage but don’t purchase."_
